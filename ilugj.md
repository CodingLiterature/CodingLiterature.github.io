title:  Indian Linux Users Group - Jammu
---

Indian Linux Users Group - Jammu was founded in 2010 by Vishal Salgotra and Amit Sharma. It started as a platform to bring the revolution of FOSS in Jammu.
Numerous seminars were organized. Free Fedora and Ubuntu CDs were distributed. As I moved out of the city and Amit into research, group activity declined.

If you are interested in reviving this group, please reach out to me or Amit Sharma.
