# This post is work in progress.

C++11 laid the foundations of Modern C++.

* strongly typed enums
* attributes
* constexpr
* delegating constructors
* user-defined literals
* explicit virtual overrides
* final specifier
* default functions
* deleted functions
* range based for loops
* special member functions for move semantics
* converting constructors
* explicit conversion functions

### auto
```auto``` variables are deduced by the compiler according to the type of initializer.
```
auto a = 42; //a is of type int
auto b = 3.14; //b is of type double
auto c = 'x'; //c is of type char
auto& d = c; //d is of type char&
auto e = new auto(42); //e is of type int*
```
C++ inherited ```auto``` keyword from C but was never used. C++11 used the keyword for better.
