“Where there is no principle in the politics, there is destruction”
                                                                                       -  Pankaj Khajuria
                                                                                       Present Govt of India under the leadership of PM Narender Modi has been witnessing that unprincipled and Unclear policies causes deteriorated condition of  Jammu Kashmir and security forces.  2014 election slogan Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas has been totally failed in both cases. In the last five years, Jammu Kashmir has been facing the worst and all-time high cease firing Violation. The number of  Militant Attacks has been increasing year by year in the last 5 years.  The people of Jammu Kashmir has been feeling betrayed for the last five years.
On security forces matter, the Modi government has been starving the armed forces of critical resources for modernization. The percentage of GDP devoted to defense has gone down to a low of 1.44%. The three arms of the military have not even got enough money to pay for past acquisitions, leave alone acquire vital equipment for urgently needed modernization.BJP Govt has  BJP overlooking the matter of national security and safety of Security forces. 
Let's have a look at Modi unclear approach towards national security and safety of security forces. December 2015, Indian PM landed at Lahore to celebrate Birthday of  Indian enemy’s PM. Then following the Uri attack, it launched the so-called surgical strike. But when equally serious attacks took place in Nagrota and Sunjuwan in the 2016-18 period the government did nothing. Then came the 2019 Pulwama blast and now he is busy to capitalize it for the vote. 
After the analysis of the above equation, it has been found that his unclear approach and unprincipled attitude makes national security in danger. The Modi government’s actual handling of the security challenges has been pretty poor. In its watch, the country has suffered grievous attacks in Pathankot, Uri, Nagrota, Sunjwan, and Pulwama and no one has been accountable for them.
 
Present Govt is unable to answer on the economy, employment and national security.  He compromises with national security and safety of Security forces. The border firing cases have been increased almost 200 times in his tenure. The attacks on security forces and abduction of security forces have been increased and started in his tenure respectively. And it is the height of unaccountability that no one from his Govt takes the responsibility of these attacks and abduction. PM Narender  Modi is asking people to cast vote in his favor because of his nationalism attitude. I would like to ask him, what stops you to show sympathy for people who killed in border firing. Last year in May when he was at Gen Zorawar Singh Auditorium Jammu to lay foundations stones for the ring road.  He was just 20 Km from the International and border people were living in the tents far from their houses. But respected PM Narender Modi didn’t spare a time to meet them. He used words chowkidar with a great interest for himself but he forgets to show sympathy towards eight-year-old infant Nitin Kumar, who killed in border firing. I would like to ask you, dear PM Narender Modi, why didn’t you talk about nationalism at that time? Why didn’t you tell that your Chowkidari was failed to protect an infant from an enemy and you were cant even have a condolence words for him? What stopped you?  Being an Indian, please reply why there is a selective approach for your chowkidar and nationalism?
