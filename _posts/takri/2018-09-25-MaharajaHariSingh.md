## “This beautiful world has hardly remembered  any Character, but people of this world always remember and admire the visionary action of any Character” - Pankaj Khajuria.


 Being a Maharaja, he had many qualities, which makes him visionary and legend.  He was like a military leader who belives in making, building and maintaining the confidence, lifestyle, and dignity of his own  state people and place. He worked very hard to make secure the basic needs of his people. If we go through the history, it has been found that Maharaja Shab was very keen towards:
* Educational, 
* Judicial and 
* Economic Empowerment of the people of his State 


You may here about the ‘Right to Eduction’ in 2009. But now you may be surprised by the knowing the fact that Maharaja Shab had made primary education complusory for all and free education for the girls. For the  Justice and legal practices, he had made a High Court. He was well aware about the fact that development and growth of any individual and society depends upon the  Economic/Financial security. By forming the  Jammu And Kashmir Bank, he had provided the financial security to his people specially to Kashmiris. Beyond these basic things, he was focused on the development and welfare of  people. He had brought the Civil Services Recruitment board for the state employment. For the better performance of the institution, he was much focused on the skill and talent of people. Now a days we are listening about the Skill full india and schemes. But it was Maharaja Shab who had introduced the scholarship schemes for Skillfull youth of the state, which ultimately makes institutions more productive. He had introduced the State Subject law, one of the best and visionary thing done by him, which are still making us more secure and prosperous.


Beyond these actions which empowers his people, Maharaja Shab was  a man of his words and actions. A true epitome of Dogra identity.  He stood for the dignity and the respect of own state.  After ascending the throne of Maharaja of State, He immediately ordered for the State flag at Gilgit along with Union Jack. He justified his stand by saying, “Gilgit is on lease to Britisher and it is not purchased by Britishers”. He was a man who believed in Justice and take responsibility for his own action.  In 1930-1931, during RoundTable conference at London , Maharaja of Jammu Kashmir was the only Maharaja of India who stood in front of  King George V and demanded an equality of Status and a Position of honour for his entire motherland, India, in the British Commonwealth nations. During his course of speech Maharaja Shab said, “Allied by treaty within the British crown and within our territories independent rulers, we have come with a full sense of responsibility to our state and to all India. As Allies of Britain, we stand solidly by the British connection. As a Indian and loyal to land whence we drive our birth and infant nurture, we stand as solidly as the rest of our countrymen for our land’s enjoyment of a position of honour and equality in The British Commonwealth nation.” And he was the Maharaja of Non-British India and sovereign state. Where has no other Maharaja of British India had made demand. In another event when Raiders had attacked Jammu Kashmir, he was at Srinagar, he asked his soldier if raiders were able to cross the Baramulla, then shoot me before they reach Srinagar. 


Being a ruler he said, “Justice is my religion”. He followed it throughout his life. But the main thing which comes out by studying his character is that he was a man of his words and action with a spirit of Service and Sacrifice like a true Soldiers who stands for the dignity of his place, who empowers and cares for his people, who believes in democratic practices,who believes in people Intellectualism, Wisdom, and Welfare. We should follow his steps.
