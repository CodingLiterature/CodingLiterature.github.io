Life is the only precious and irreplaceable part of God Creation. The survival of life belongs to the future and the future belongs to an Investment. Whereas an Investment is an art of making efforts for a safe and secure future, which are the two basic fundamentals of development and growth. And where there is growth there is life. When we talk about investment, it comes about monetary gain, profit, assets building, dividend, bonus, beach walk, foreign living etc in our mind. But all these are secondary aspects of investment and the primary aspect belongs to the social safety and security.

In a democratic nation, people cast their vote as an investment for their safe and secure future followed by development. So being a part of democratic but fragile state of Jammu Kashmir, when we talk about Jammu, the place which helps others as an elder brother, the safety and security of the Jammu and Dogras become more crucial. At social part, Jammu always plays an active as well as mature role but Jammu always feels betrayal and second-hand treatment by politics. The recent ineffective and unprincipled politics has created a Jammu dilemma as a Social Dilemma. For better Jammu, each and every individual Dogra’s effort is proving as a collective damage of Jammu. As a psychotherapist said,

## “Politics without principle, destroy the Human race” ― Anthony De Mello 

And it has been proven right in the case of Jammu’s Social dilemma. The gap between the people and their representatives are at the peak of all time. The lack of interest of representatives towards the people’s demand and their more inclination towards the party goal brought a dilemma. The government has a script to follow under the smokescreen of unaccountability.  At the same time, they are running away from their responsibilities. The unaccountability and unanswerability created a wide gap between the society and politics. It has not brought only a pain for people but also shattered the faith of people. Society and politics are the interlinked force. As a subset of society people of Jammu plays their role at very best. But unprincipled, unanswerable and unaccountable politics always hurt and erode people of Jammu. Due to this, Jammu has been going through: -

* Physical pain.
* Psychological disturbance.
* Emotional distraction.
* Spiritual erosion.


### Physical pain
After casting and participating with full enthusiasm. Dogras have been feeling a physical pain due to cyclic border firing by Pakistan. According to the data, there has been over 300% increase in the incidents of cross-border firing along the India-Pakistan border in this year up to May, followed by 111 unprovoked cross-border firing instances in 2017, 204 incidents were in 2016, 350 were in 2015 and 127 during 2014. Continuous border firing is killing people. It not only makes their future insecure but also make their present more vulnerable and instigated. In the 21st century where children are able to get integrated as well as artificial intelligence education but at the same time it is hard for children of Jammu Border to concentrate and focus on their studies. It has added an insult to their injury when they even cannot go at school on 26 January as a Republic day. 
Besides this people has been struggling for their survival. Agriculture is the primary sector of Jammu. People of Jammu are thankful to their ancestors who have made canals. But at present, the level of incompetent politics is at such level, that we have canals but don’t have water for irrigation or have a scarcity of water in the canals. In Jammu, there are many places where there is no canal water for the last couple of years. People and Zamindari of that area totally depend upon “Bhagwan Bharose.” Forget the living standard, it makes things more vulnerable and insecure due to misrepresentation and unheard.


### Psychological disturbance
In the present time representation has its own value. Due to the power of social media, it is easy to exchange and share the information. But at the one end people has been continuously enjoying a beach walk, parties, community meetings and they share as well as represent it at social media platform on the other end people have been continuously facing and sharing Shelling, light as well as water scarcity, internet curfew. And if we talk about the inter-region comparison, the anti-national and incompetent youth of sister region have been able to get amnesty, rewards as well as secured job and on the other hand youth of Jammu, a Nationalist, Competent and Well-Educated remain unrecognized and doesn’t get space. This all make their future, aloof and insecure. This has created a huge psychological disturbance just because of misrepresentation and in unprincipled politics. 


### Emotionally distraction
Beat around the brush is people are experiencing the mood swings and overwhelmed with emotion. Due to betrayal and used feeling they find it difficult to relate to colleagues, friends or their partner out of fear of getting close to people. Helpless and alone are the emotions which rule the body and distrust make an important place.  


### Spiritual erosion
When the people or society play their role very effectively as well as responsibly and they feel betrayed, alone, helpless, used and most importantly when someone declined or forget her words by getting influence seat, it adds insult to their injury. People feel the spiritual erosion because of the distrust. They feel empty and question about the purpose of their life.


A social dilemma of Jammu not only makes people insecure about the future security but also make their present vulnerable and distressed. The effect of any social dilemma is changing in core collectively decision making. People prefer individual development instead of mutual growth. The dual approach and insecurity remain the main heading force due to Social Dilemma. And believe me, if you look around you will find the dual and insecure nature of people. But we can overcome the Social dilemma by strong willpower and mutual trust. We have to stand and become self-reliant for the security of our people and the development of our children as a future. As we all easily find the fundamental teaching and learning of Jammu people is “Insaan da ke zoor hai oo te sirf kari sakda hai, baki sab Rab di Marzi hai.” So, the need of the hour is to follow the fundamentals. Even in Gita Ji, it has said,

## “Rise above modes of material nature., O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.”
