Once there was a place which is situated on the bank of Tawi river and foothills of Trikuta ranges, known as a city of temples, capital of refugees, a hub of education & trades, sovereign & independent soil of British India, land of rich heritage and culture sites. It is none other than Jammu. History is the witness of Jammu till date didn’t have a foreign ruler whereas the other States of India have a foreign ruler. It is a matter of pride for the whole nation that there is a part in India which remains ruled by their own inheritance.

But what is a Jammu? Jammu is a piece of land from Lakhanpur to Banihal and Poonch which is known for Dogra’s Courage, service, and vision. Jammu, Dogras, stretched Indian Boundaries up to the Himalayas, who was only an example of Indian martial History to fought with external threat and protect us by Russia, China, and Afganistan. Jammu a dream city for education, trade, and business pre-1947 and ¯post-1947 as well. It will not be wrong if we can say Jammu was a powerhouse of guts and glory. Jammu was a place where people gets empowerment in the form of institutions like Jammu Kashmir Police, State subjects (nowadays PRC with the support of 370 and 35 A), Jammu Kashmir High Courts, Jammu Kashmir Bank, Hospitals, Schools, Colleges, canals. We can imagine the advancement our ancestors who at the one end fought at the heights of 15,000 feet under – 20-degree temperature and on the other end, they left no stone unturned to make empowering institution for their people. These all things were possible because of three things: ability, motivation, and attitude of Jammu people, Dogras. 


But Do we have the same Jammu Today ? for me no, we don’t have the same Jammu. So next question is why don’t we have the same Jammu? Again for me, it is due to Kashmir center policy and Unholy politics of Delhi. Today Jammu is a piece of land, whose river and forest are grabbed by non-local people with unholy intent. Jammu is a piece of land whose local people, Dogras are being surrounded by other people as a strategy. Jammu is a piece of land whose people are deliberately forced to see the structural and emotional destruction of their ancestors' visionary institute. Either it is Mubarak Mandi, Jammu Kashmir Bank, Schools, Canals, Jammu Kashmir Police, museum. Jammu is a piece of land whose people are intentially forced to live in a psychological disturbance and emotional erosion environment. It will not be wrong if I can say Jammu, the Dreamland turned into a land of discrimination.


Don’t we need to introspect that we are much more responsible for this discrimination? The Kashmir centric policies not only discriminating for Jammu but also lethal for Kashmir too. We have seen that Kashmir has gone through major destruction and instability. If people in Jammu are anxious then people in Kashmir is depressed. But Kashmiri politician is whole sole responsible for this. After heading the state for the last 71 years, they are unable to give a secure and dignified life to their people. They way Kashmir is responsible for their own destruction, we, Dogras are too responsible for this discrimination towards our people of Jammu. When local Dogras after having a better education settle and marry outside for their future and luxuries life. It makes a dent on the inspiration of people who left behind. They started to show uninterest towards his people and institution which is very unlike to our ancestors' ability, motivation, and attitude. The attitude of the youth especially, the girl could be, **“Bahar  settle/wale ladke se shadi kare gein, goome gein aish karen gien, Jammu mai zindagi ka mazza nahi”**. This is nothing but a delibrate attempt to deprive own people and make sure to create a social deficit. Which is more harmful than Kashmir centric policy. 


It is high time demand and challenge to end discrimination with Dogras, people of Jammu. It can be ended only by standing shoulder to shoulder with loyalty and integrity among themselves. Besides this to protect the institutions, which was started by our ancestors is the biggest challenge for us. For Delhi and Srinagar, they are just a medium of departmental operations and processes but for us, these institutions are Legacy, Identity and Emotional entity.
