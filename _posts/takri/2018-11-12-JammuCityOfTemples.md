After long awaits, Jammu has got its Mayor. No doubt Clean and Green Jammu will add the serenity effect of the city.  But besides this Jammu basically needs to work on two important folds, first one for the local people of Jammu and the second one for the tourists of Jammu, the city of Temples.

Local people: -  Jammu needs to provide more advanced facilities and basic necessities to local people.  Like Clean water, air, sewage system and congestion free traffic.  Jammu must provide double decker buses for employees from Muthi to Bus stand and Kunjwani to Bus stand.  Jammu city is the economic hub for outskirts of the city, needs to develop a single window under one roof hub centre for local markets. Jammu’s Hospitals should be in a workable condition on a regular basis. Their facilities should be upgraded. The heritage sites of Jammu city need to be preserved with immediate effect.  Institutions engagement should be involved to preserve heritage sites.   

On the other hand, Jammu is the centre of tourist attraction. Tourist friendly infrastructure and accessibility needs to develop in an immediate effect.  Jammu needs to join the dots of lifelines of Jammu (Airport- Railway station- Bus Stand) under a single platform, where tourist can easily know the information and facilities regarding his/her visit. 

Besides this, for the last many years it has seen that flash floods in Janipur areas.  Need to develop Rapid action teams’ to deal with any untoward incidents. 

Let's make a Jammu Clean, Green, Smart, heritage and culturally rich, economic, tourist hub city.
