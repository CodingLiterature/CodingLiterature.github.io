Later who played an important role in the demarcation of Boundaries of Indian Subcontinent, people-friendly reforms and securing the soil and people from external threats (China, Russia, Afghanistan and now Pakistan). Maharaja Gulab singh is not just a name of Royalty but an ambassador of hard work, courage, loyalty, integrity, services and sacrifices. According to KN Pannikar, he is the only soldier and statesman of Indian Subcontinent. He is a hero of Military leadership, sharp administrative and finest diplomat, who joined forces as a Soldier but due to his courage, loyalty and integrity raised upto commander Rank of Military and later turned Raja and Maharaja. Most importantly, He is a Great Dogra warrior, General and Maharaja. He was the one who never hesitated to jump into the battle for his people, place and master. The formation of Jammu Kashmir state is a result of his service, sacrifices and Vision. 


On coronation Day of Maharaja Gulab Singh. Let's be more aware about him:- 


### As a Military Leader: “It doesn’t take a hero to order men into battle. It takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle.” – General Norman Schwarzkopf.


Gulab singh is just one of them. In the battle of Gumat, When Bhai Hukam singh of Lahore Darbar attacked Jammu, then just at the age of 16 years, he didn’t hesitate to jump into the battle and distinguished himself in the battle of Gumat. Hukam singh of Lahore darbar was defeated very badly and left to Sialkote. 


Being a warrior, his qualities was appreciated by Raja Ranjit singh of Lahore Darbar and he asked him to join his force. In 1809, he joined Sikh force of Raja Ranjit singh as a foot soldier. After joining the Sikh force, Gulab singh played a pivotal role in extending the Lahore darbar Boundaries. He campaigned and stretched Boundaries from Pamirs to Sind and from Peshawar to Sutlej.


Now Raja Ranjit singh turned into Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Lahore Darbar. 


According to General Dwight D Eisenhower, “the supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity and loyalty. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office."
Gulab singh was well trained about the these qualities by his Grandfather Mian Zorawar singh. Integrity and loyalty towards his master Maharaja Ranjit singh, were the two main qualities of Gulab Singh. During the seize of Multan, one of the Sardar fell dead at very foot of the fort. The besiegers were being subjected to heavy cannon fire and Ranjit singh, who was fond of the dead Sardar, commanded his officers to ride to the spot and bring back the dead body. No one ventured except Gulab singh, without a little delay, at the drop of the hat he rushed forward to the amazement of the whole army and brought back on his horse the body of his dead comrade. Hence Gulab singh's loyalty towards his master attracted Maharaja Ranjit singh’s favourable notice. 


Imbued with the spirit of courage, Valour, Adventure and Gallantry, Gulab Singh rose to be an astute strategist of Maharaja Ranjit singh. As a military commander, he rendered meritorious services to his master in all campaigns especially Multan which was invincible before Gulab singh, despite of multiple time of attack Lahore darbar was unable to captured. It becomes possible only after Gulab singh campaigned. Along with Multan, Attock, Kabul, Kashmir, Kandhar, Manerka, Dera Gazi, Reasi, Kishtwar and NWFP area seized by Exemplary courage and finest strategy of Gulab Singh. Besides this with the help of bold strategy he captured Agha Khan of Rajouri Raja and Neutralised Mian Dido. With his remarkable contributions, conscientious and loyal services, Maharaja Ranjit singh could easily  expand and consolidate his empire. Realising the importance of Dogra and Strategic importance of Dogra land. Maharaja Ranjit singh rewarded Gulab singh service, integrity and loyalty by making him a Raja of Jammu Jagir. Maharaja Ranjit singh performed Rajtilak on the bank of Chenab River. On 17 June 1822, Gulab singh was anointed as Raja of Jammu at Jia Pota Ghat, Akhnoor by Maharaja Ranjit Singh himself.  Maharaja Ranjit singh himself applied a Tilak at Gulab singh forehead from upward to downward direction. Usually Tilak apply from downward to upward direction but here it happened in reverse direction. By applying this Maharaja Ranjit singh said, he is sowing a seed within the depth of soil, where the roots of Gulab singh and his family successors strengthened to serve the soil and local people. 
It was the game changer day for Dogras and Indian Subcontinent, Where a service of common Dogra recognised by any Maharaja. Who joined his forces as a Foot Soldiers but due to his courage, loyalty and integrity raised upto commander Rank of Military and later turned Raja. 


Throughout the world there is no example like this where a foot soldier become Commander, Raja and then Maharaja. Besides this the words of Maharaja has been proving true since 1822. After becoming a Raja of Jammu Gulab singh stretched Indian Subcontinent Boundaries upto Himalayas. By restricting Britishers at outside of Jammu Kashmir, he puts the pride and proud ribbon on the chest of independent India. Now we can say that we were unable to rule crown of independent India. After Maharaja Gulab singh his successors stretched Indian Boundaries upto Gilgit and provide protection from external threat of Afghanistan, China and Russia. His successors brought reforms to uplift the socio-economic condition of people either it is School, College, university, Panchayat, Canal, Road, Bank, High court, Police, Army force, etc. In 19th and 20 century, It is very rare and hard to find such developments by any Raja or Maharaja of respective regions. 


The word of Maharaja Ranjit singh has been proving true by Royal family of JK. Present Maharaja Dr Karan singh is an eminent scholar and renowned Dogra personality of world. Who makes us all Dogra a very proud Dogras. 



Hence, 17 June is a Game Changers and important day for all. When a Dogra Boy rewarded by his master and later he and his family left no stone unturned to proven his master words.
