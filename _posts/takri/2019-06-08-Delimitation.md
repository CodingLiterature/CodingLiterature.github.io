Nowadays delimitation becomes a talk of the town. Let’s know what is delimitation? Delimitation commission is an exercise of redrawing the boundaries of constituencies (Parliamentary as well as Assembly). It works on the formula of uniform Population and Seat ratio.

## History and Background

The first delimitation was done in 1952 and the third delimitation committee was set up in 1972, which completed its work by 1975. But The Constitution 42nd Amendment had put a ban on any further delimitation of constituencies till 2000 and the total number of seats in the Lok Sabha and the Assemblies had remained the same till then. With the passing of the 91st Constitutional Amendment Bill, the ban would actually mean a freeze for more than 50 years. Till 2026, the ban had been proposed as the population planners have projected that by 2026 the population of India would stabilize and the country could hope to have zero growth rate of population thereafter.

## Importance of Delimitation

The redrawing of boundaries helps to end the discrimination and discrepancies among the constituencies. The constant rise in the population has caused an enormous growth in the electorate. Besides this migration helps to gain the electorate. These electorates are not uniform in all the constituencies. Urban constituencies facing the constant pressure of population migration had witnessed a faster rate of increase in the electorate as compared to other constituencies. So the basic importance of delimitation is to end the discrimination and discrepancies. 

## Why delimitation is creating a buzz in Jammu Kashmir state?

For the last 71 years, Kashmir has been heading the Govt of State Jammu Kashmir. During these years Kashmir has gone to worst. Today at one side Kashmir is going to the hell and another side Jammu has been becoming a victim of discrimination. 

The last time delimitation exercise took place in 1995 under the Governor Raj of Gen KV Krishna. Jammu Kashmir assembly seats have increased to 87 from 76. It has frozen in 2002 by Farooq Abdullah Government. As per ruling the next delimitation should have logically taken place in 2005. But there are huge discrepancies among the constituencies and these discrepancies causes discrimination with Jammu. let’s have a look at the ground reality. In Jammu, Gandhi Nagar(1.66 lakh), Jammu west (1.51 lakh) have the highest number of voters and Nubra (13 K), Gurez (17 K), Zanskar (20 K), Karnah (32 K). Even total sum of Nubra Gurez Zanskar and Karnah voters is less than Jammu west Constituency voters. The population density of Gandhi Nagar is much denser than others. See the differences, discrepancies, and discrimination with Jammu. Does the value of the vote in the Gandhi Nagar and Karnah constituencies remain the same? Is it justified in having a similar expenditure limit fixed for these two constituencies? Is it right to have a similar amount of developmental fund available for the dissimilar size of the electorate?

## Politics over Delimitation

Politics on delimitation is not a new concept. CM GN Azad headed Government(2003-2008) had proposed a 25 percent increment in the total number of assemblies seats. But NC in the opposition didn’t let it happen.

Recently Omar Abdullah and other valley leader expressed surprise and said, right now delimitation of Jammu Kashmir will be called as forced delimitation because freeze on delimitation has been applied to the entire country by SC up to 2026. But they forget to tell that Jammu Kashmir state has 370 and it empowers to Governor of the state to amend section 47 (delete the objectionable provision) and Sec 3 of the Representation of People Act Gives the Governor the mandate to constitute Delimitation commission.

Why Do BJP brought delimitation into an active role? We all know BJP unable to abolish the 370 and 35A, which is also not possible in real sense. At the same time, BJP knows people are unhappy with their local leaders. So they brought delimitation, it gives an edge to BJP over Cong and NC regional Autonomy theory.
