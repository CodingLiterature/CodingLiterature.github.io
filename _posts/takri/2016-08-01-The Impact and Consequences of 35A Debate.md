The northern most state of India, Jammu Kashmir is always a centre of attraction at national as well as international level. There is a battle at international level for Jammu Kashmir and one wihtin Jammu kashmir. We have embattled for the emotions, identity and power sharing. This is why the current 35A debate is the hot potato. 35A debate is not only limited to any particular orginasation or political parties but is a brainstroming exercise for individuals. In the technology and social media world, representation of anything matters a lot which is catalysed by lobby systems and alliances.

But the interseting consequences of 35A debate is Kahsmiris are united on their mutual and common stand whereas Jammu looks divided on it. So it is very important to understand why Kashmiris are united and Jammu is divided, when the decision belongs to the court on legal practices amd has nothing to do with mass protest or lobby system.

## Jammu

1. They are standing for many causes.
2. They are politically as well as socially divided.
3. Politcal parties have no mutual and common goal.                                                                            
4. There is no leading by examples, except Ankur Sharma for the selfless cause.
5. Society have a used and betrayed feeling.
6. Women who have choosen to live far from Jammu, are questioning and targeting the people who help to flourish Jammu.
7. Self interest, vested interest and individual cause are ruling Jammu.
8. Those who raises questions are well settled and mostly living outside of Jammu. They have nothing to loose but It creates a trust deficit.
9. Individuals have double stand as per their convenience.

## Kashmir

1. They are standing for the Common cause.
2. They are politically divided but socially connected.
3. Rival political parties are sharing same platform for mutual/commom goal.
4. They are leading with examples.
5. Society have inter faith.
6. Men supports women and vice versa.
7. Common and mass cause are ruling Kashmiris.
8. Those who are leading, they live and spend their life at Kashmir. it creates a mutual trust.
9. There is no individual double stand irrespective of their convenience.

It has also been seen that those women who are married to non State Subject are blaming for gender discrimantion. It is really sad to say it is the height of the misreprentation. Actually, those who have married outside, they choose their life away from the fragile conditons of state for their enjoyment of life. And if no, let them to decline it. They have not only violated the fundamental duties of constitution but also as per the  constituon of India, Article 15 (1) and (2) prohibit the state from discriminating any citizen on ground of any religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, discriminating the male on the ground of ‘place of birth’ as a state. As they discriminate their male citizens of same generation. And it is an insult to an injury that they are now raising hoaxes of gender discrimination. Wherever we say that ‘heredity property issue’ needs to addressed whatever  the decision may be taken on 35A by court. But the truth remains same, in both the cases - inter faith gap in Jammu will be widened and unity in Kashmir will be stronger untill unless we don’t listen to our own people of Jammu.  If we really want the development of Jammu Kashmir and her people. Then we should rise above the individual - political interest and have to spread education and awareness for common cause like Ankur Sharma.
