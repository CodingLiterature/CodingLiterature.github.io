The northern most state of India, Jammu Kashmir always be a centre of attraction at national as well as international level.  There is a battle at international level for Jammu Kashmir and within Jammu kashmir, we have an embattled for the emotions, identity and  power sharing. That is why the current 35A debate is the hot potato. 35A debate is  not only limited to any particular orginasation or political parties but also a brainstroming exercise for  individuals. In the technology and social media world representation of anything matters a lot which is catalysed by lobby systems and alliances.

But the interseting consequences of 35A debate is Kahsmiris are united on their mutal and common stand  and Jammu are looking divided on it. So it is very important to understand why Kashmiris are united and Jammu are divided. Where as the decision belongs to court on legal practices which has nothing to do with mass protest or lobby system.
         
##Jammu
1.	They are standing for the many cause.
2.	They are politically as well as socially divided.
3.	Politcal parties have no mutual and common goal.                                                                             
4.	There is no leading by examples, except Ankur Sharma for the selfless cause.
5.	Society have an used and betrayal feeling.
6.	Women who has choosen to live far from Jammu, are questioning and targeting the people who helps to flourish the Jammu.
7.	Self interest, vested interest and individual cause are ruling Jammu.         
8.	Those who raises questions are well settled and mostly living at outside of Jammu. They have nothing to loose but It creates a trust deficit.
9.	Individuals have double stand as per their convenience.

##Kashmir
1.	They are standing for the Common cause.
2.  They are politically divided but socially connected.
3.	Rival political parties are sharing same platform for mutual/commom goal.
4.  They are leading with examples.
5.  Society have inter faith.
6.	Men supports women and vice versa.
7.	Common and mass cause are ruling Kashmiris.
8.	Those who are leading, they live and spend their life at Kashmir. it creates a mutual trust.
9.	There is no individual double stand irrespective of their convenience.

It has also been seen that those women who married to non state subject are blaming for gender discrimantion. It is really sad to say it is the height of the misreprentation.  Actually , those who have married outside, they choose their life away from the fragile conditons of state for their enjoyment of life. And if no, let them to decline it. They have not only violated the fundamental duties of constitution but also as per the  constituon of India, Article 15 (1) and (2) prohibit the state from discriminating any citizen on ground of any religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them,  discriminating the male on the ground of ‘place of birth’as a state. As they discriminate their male citizens of same generation. And it is an insult to an injury that they are now raising a hoaxes gender discrimination for themselves. Wherever we can say that ‘heredity property issue’ need to address.  Whatever  the decision may be taken on 35A by court. But the truth remains same, in both  the cases inter faith gap in Jammu will be widened and unity in Kashmir will be stronger untill unless we don’t listen our own people of Jammu.  If we really want the development of Jammu Kashmir and her people. Then we should rise above the individual- political interest and have to spread education and awareness for common cause like Ankur Sharma.

###Jai Hind!
