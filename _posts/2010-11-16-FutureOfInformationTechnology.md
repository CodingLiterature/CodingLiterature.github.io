Future Technologies will put this world on the tip of a pen - small, precise and in the access of everyone, anywhere, anytime. In a few not years but days, Cloud Computing and Virtual Reality will change the way we use computing resources and will give rise to new ways to interact with and use machines. Cloud Computing will led to cloud (internet) based synchronized computing and Virtual Reality will give rise to virtual worlds â€“ worlds of imaginations. Virtual meetings will led us to pass emotions and shake hands while on a phone call. Semantic Web, Machine Vision, Exocortices, Memristor, 3D Display would give machines their individual identity. On the other side evolution of Information Technology will be led to human evolution mostly characterized by Brain Technologies that will supplement a human in every aspect. Intelligent embedded systems would supplement human memory. Use of Nanotechnology for trans-humanism will evolutionize a Homo-Sapiens to a Homo-Technicus hoping the Future predictions not to be dystopian.
